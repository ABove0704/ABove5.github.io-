      <p style="background-color:blue; font-size:20px; color:white;"> The article ‚ÄúAs We May Think,‚Äù written in 1945 by Vannevar Bush,reflects on the possibilities of how technology will develop down the road. Bush nails down points of pieces of technology that are developed today. He talks about the development of dry photographs and how photos are instantly made when they are taken. In today‚Äôs generation, photos are taken within seconds with our iPhones and there is no waiting time to develop a photo. The development of the iPhone has changed the prospects of people not having to carry around a portable camera that needs to be with them. The way photographs were taken back then shocked me while I was reading because Bush predicted what the future will look like with the camera being more accessible to use. He also goes into how microphotographs are the future. Microphotographs exist today within our phones through seeing a mini version of a photo that someone took of a bridge or the sky. Bush predicts that there will be a device called the memex in which everything will be accessible right in front of everyone's eyes. The memex was an idea of how books, records, and communication will be put together into one form of a device. The memex shocked me because he predicted the future of smart devices without knowing it becoming true. Bush describes that the Vocoder is a device that listens to a person's response and repeats it out loud for them. The Vocoder honestly amazed me hen Bush talked about it because he predicted the use of voice commands which is outstanding to see someone say that in the late 40s. I feel like people must of thought he was crazy to say that there will be a device to listen to your voice and respond to you. It sounds like Google Assistant which people can ask to spell a word they don't know how to spell. Google instantly responds with the word and tells you how to spell it.

      <p style="background-color:blue; font-size:20px; color:white;"> Bush's predictions had many possibilities of how technology is formed today which Tim Berners-Lee talks about in his article ‚ÄúLong Live The Web.‚Äù Tim Berners-Lee was the first person to access the Web in Geneva, Switzerland in 1990. There were no privacy concerns, HTTP, and URI codes, and the Internet was free. Jeff Bezos, the creator of Amazon did not have to pay to create his website; all he had to do was create the website with HTML and HTTP format coding. It was a simple time because anyone in the world could communicate with each other over the web with an Internet connection. In the present day, websites and the Internet bring up concerns of privacy issues for users. The government is in control of everyone's every move and what they are doing on the Internet. The French government made a law called Hadopi to prevent anyone from ripping off downloading music and videos on the web. This law is still true today as ripping off music is still a legal issue around the world, not just in France. The YouTubeMP3 website constantly gets taken down due to legal issues of users trying to rip off music to add it to their smartphones without paying a price for music. I agree with this statement because the information is being accessed too easily by users these days. This honestly didn't come as a surprise to me because I understand that ripping off music online is illegal, and I respect artists enough to buy my own music without ripping it off. The Federal Communications Commission blocked the website BitTorrent for Internet trafficking because videos and music are being shared for free without creators‚Äô and artists‚Äô permission. This sounds unfair to the users that want to share with their buddies a song they like to listen to. Lee states that the web is not a safe place anymore and more privacy concerns should be put in place. Users' personal data are being taken on Facebook and Linkedin to gather information about them. This information is stored away without users knowing. The web can be very dangerous because Facebook employees know every little detail about your life now. Both articles reflect on the future of technology and what it brings to the table today.
